The good news is that you've been able to located the display that shows the password. The bad news is that the pixels on the screen have been entagled and started to move some time ago! You quickly take a snap shot of the positions and velocity of the pixels. Each row contains a specific pixel in the following format
(x-position, y-position, x-velocity, y-velocity).

Given the row (4,9,3,-2) at the time T that pixel will be located at (4+3=7, 9-2=7) at T+1 and and (4+3+3=10, 9-2-2=5) at T+2.

Due to SCIENCE you can assume that the pixels are moving at a constant speed so if you figure out a way to travel BACK in time you should be able to recreate how the screen looked like at a previous point in time. If you find the correct point in time you should be able to see the password. Let's start the time travelling and find that password!
